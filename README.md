# AI Game Agents Collection

Welcome to the **AI Game Agents Collection** repository! This project brings together AI implementations for various classic games, including Tic-Tac-Toe, Sliding Puzzles, and logic-based challenges. Each AI is designed to play optimally using algorithms such as Minimax, heuristics, and search-based techniques.

## Included AI Game Agents

### Tic-Tac-Toe Variants
- [5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe AI](https://github.com/savka777/5x5-Tic-Tac-Toe) – A larger board variation with enhanced AI strategies.
- [3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax](https://github.com/savka777/3x3-Tic-Tac-Toe-Minimax) – Classic Tic-Tac-Toe solved using the Minimax algorithm.

### Puzzle Games
- [8-Piece Sliding Puzzle Solver](https://github.com/savka777/8-Piece-Sliding-Puzzle) – AI solver for the classic sliding puzzle game.

### Logic-Based Challenges
- [Corn, Goose, and Fox Problem](https://github.com/savka777/Corn-Goose-Fox-Problem) – AI solution to the famous river-crossing puzzle.
